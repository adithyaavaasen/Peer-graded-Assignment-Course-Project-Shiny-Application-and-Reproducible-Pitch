# Developing Data Products - Course Project 

This repository has the files for the second part of the Developing Data Products Course Project. The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application. 

The app developed for the first part of the assignment is avalilable at:
 https://adithyaa27.shinyapps.io/dataproducts/

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub:
